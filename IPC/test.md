This is *still* a motherfucking website.
========================================

And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.

Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.
----------------------------------------------------------------

**7 fucking declarations.**

That's how much CSS it took to turn that [grotesque pile of
shit](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) into this easy-to-read
masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it *still* has all the glory of
the original perfect-ass website:

-   Shit's *still* lightweight and loads fast
-   *Still* fits on all your shitty screens
-   *Still* looks the same in all your shitty browsers
-   The motherfucker's *still* accessible to every asshole that visits
    your site
-   Shit's *still* legible and gets your fucking point across

### And guess what, motherfucker:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.
Here's how.

Let it breathe
--------------

Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming
they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are
trash -- pick a minimum `line-height: 1.4` for body copy. Headings
should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever
see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.

A little less contrast
----------------------

Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life?
Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background
a nice `#EEEEEE` if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a
lean 7 fucking lines.

Size Matters
------------

I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy
to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not
the screen.

Line-width, motherfucker
------------------------

Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line
of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and
users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless
dribble.

### Yes, this is *also* fucking satire, you fuck

I love what the creator of [this site's
inspiration](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) did. What I'm saying is
that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are
broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible,
but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out
there need to make them not total shit.
